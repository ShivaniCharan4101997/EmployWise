# EmployWise Frontend Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a React-based user management system that allows users to log in, view a list of users, edit user details, and delete users. The app ensures proper authentication, state management, and error handling.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm or yarn

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employwise-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build the Project for Production**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run Tests (If Applicable)**
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Rules and Guidelines

### 1. Framework & Libraries
- You must use **React** as the frontend framework.
- State management tools like **Redux** or **Context API** are optional.
- Use **fetch API** or **Axios** for making HTTP requests.

### 2. User Interface
- The UI should be **user-friendly and responsive** (desktop and mobile).
- Use any CSS framework (**Bootstrap, Material-UI, Tailwind CSS**) or custom CSS.

### 3. Error Handling
- Handle API errors gracefully and display **appropriate error messages**.
- Implement **form validation** for login and edit screens.

### 4. Persistence
- Store the **login token** in localStorage or sessionStorage.
- Redirect users to the **login page** if the token is missing or expired.

### 5. Code Quality
- Ensure **clean, modular, and well-documented code**.
- Use proper React components, hooks, and lifecycle methods.

### 6. Submission
- Provide a **GitHub repository** link containing your code.
- Include a README file explaining:
    - How to **run the project**
    - How to **install dependencies**
    - Any **assumptions or considerations** made

### 7. AI Usage
- You may use **ChatGPT**, but completing the assignment **on your own** earns extra points.

### 8. Bonus Points
- Implement **client-side search and filtering** in the user list.
- Use **React Router** for page navigation (**Login, User List, Edit User**).
- Host the project on a **free server** like Vercel or Heroku and provide the deployment link.

## Deployment
To deploy the app on **Vercel**:
```sh
vercel
```
